1. Research & brainstorm to identify user roles
2. Research & brainstorm to identify user stories for each role
3. Categorize user stories into product components, or at least groups of similar stories
4. Flag stories as "MVP" which are needed in order to release a minimum viable product
5. Use the flagged stories to help decide which components to build for initial release
6. Visualize workflow(s) for various user roles using the components to accomplish their goals
7. Create rough designs of product components
8. Refine designs of components with detailed functional requirements and UI designs
9. Re-validate that detailed designs and requirements satisfy the user stories flagged as MVP

note: Steps 6+ may run concurrently with initial development activities.
