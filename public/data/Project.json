            "description": "<p>This is a drum machine with an integrated synthesizer/vocoder that I made using Native Instruments Reaktor 5. It can be a pretty fun useful tool for enhancing bland beats and creating rhythmic synth parts. Below is the original documentation. If you'd like to try it out (you'll need a copy of NI Reaktor 5), you can download the file <a href=\"/projects/reaktorDrum/Othman_reaktorDrum.zip\">here</a>:<blockquote><a href=\"/projects/reaktorDrum/Othman_reaktorDrum.zip\">Othman_reaktorDrum.zip</a></blockquote></p><h3>Othman's Drum/Synth/Sequencer Thing, Version 1.0</h3><p>This patch consists of a 16-step sequencer for triggering up to 8 drum samples, which may in turn independently trigger (or more accurately, gate) three individual oscillators. The oscillators each have their own filter, LFO, and “note chooser” among other things. An external input is also available for triggering the oscillators. Finally, there is a delay with feedback and lowpass filter. The patch is self-contained and does not make use of MIDI yet.</p><p>At the top left, there are 8 display boxes that show the filenames of the loaded samples. Double click on a box to open its properties then click on the little waveform picture to load samples. Each sample has a control for pan, level and pitch, and 4 send levels. There is a 9th box that is for the external input, which has a level indicator, gain, and highpass filter, and 3 sends.</p><p>Each column of knobs in the sends area corresponds to a destination for the sample. The first three columns are for oscillators one, two, and three, respectively, and the fourth goes to the delay. The external input doesn't have a send for the delay because it is only used as a trigger (gate). All sends are pre-fader.</p><p>The top right section of the panel is where the sequencer lives. It's pretty straight-forward, with each button representing a 16th note. Also, there's a row of indicator lights at the bottom of the sequencer grid that lights up during playback in time with the movement of the grid.</p><p>There are three oscillator sections at the bottom of the panel. They are all identical, except that oscillator one lacks the “slave” button. At the far left of the oscillator section, you will find the note chooser, where you can choose a chromatic note from the list. To the right of the note chooser is a knob which controls the octave of the chosen note, which is displayed beneath. Above this knob is a fader for the level of the oscillator. Above the fader is a selector to determine the waveshape for the oscillator: sine, sawtooth, pulse, and white noise. There's a knob to control width when pulse is selected.</p><p>To the right of the fader, there's a pan pot. To the right of the octave knob, you will find the filter for the oscillator. There are frequency and resonance knobs, and a selector to toggle between highpass, bandpass, and lowpass filters. To the right of these filter controls are the LFO parameters including rate, amount, and shape. Shapes include sine, triangle, square, and off (to deactivate the LFO). The LFO will automatically adjust the filter frequency above and below the point set on the frequency knob.</p><p>The remaining controls in the oscillator section include mode, release, groove, and ?Dly. The ?Dly knob, found in the top right corner of the box sends the oscillator's output to the delay processor. The Mode selector toggles between envelope mode and sustained mode. In envelope mode, the sum of audio sent to the oscillator (from the drums and/or external input) is used to modulate the amplitude of the oscillator, creating a triggered or gated effect. This is what you will want to use most of the time. In sustained mode, the oscillator just runs constantly. This isn't that useful, but can be fun to switch back and forth during playback. (note:  it seems like sustain mode isn't working for some reason right now. Oh well, you're not missing much.)</p><p>The release knob determines how long it takes for the oscillator's amplitude to recover from peaks when operating in envelope mode. Short release is good for fast, percussive sounds, and longer release is good for bass sounds, etc.</p><p>The “groove” controls are useful in creating different rhythms out of the triggered oscillators. The -/+ selector determines how many steps the triggered signal will be offset forward in time. The groove control, though simple, can help enliven an otherwise boring creation. The button beneath the groove selector will add an offset of 1 step (one 16th  note) only while it is held down. This is fun to mess with during playback.</p><p>You might notice that oscillators 2 and 3 also have a “slave” button, which is not present on oscillator 1. When engaged, the output of that oscillator is sent into oscillator one's filter, bypassing its own filter and pan, but keeping its pitch, shape, release, and groove setting. It will be processed by the osc 1's filter, and will also be affected by osc 1's groove setting.</p><p>The delay controls can be found on the right side of the panel, towards the bottom. This is pretty self-explanatory. You can select the delay time (measured in steps, or  16th notes) using the list. The top knob controls the level of the delay return. The middle knob controls how much of the delay's output is fed back into its input. The third knob adjusts the cutoff frequency of a lowpass filter applied to the output of the delay (pre-feedback).</p><p>Finally, the bottom right corner of the panel contains three very important controls. The “Run” button will start and stop playback. The adjacent knob is the master volume. Below these two is the tempo slider, which ranges from 60bpm to 200bpm.</p>",

            "description": "<p>This is a site / web-based application I created that helps writers outline and write stories either on their own or in collaboration with other writers. This was my first real endeavor into creating a dynamic database-driven web application, and it is written in PHP and utilizes a MySQL database backend. Features include permissions, versioning, and a unique architecture for collaboratively writing and editing stories from the ground up.</p><h4>Story Site</h4><h5>Chronological System</h5><p>A story contains chapters, chapters contain scenes, and scenes contain pages. Any object that is located on a page is also located in a scene. That scene, in turn, is located within a chapter, which is located within a story. In this way, anything with a location is part of a given story. Within a given scene, each object in that scene has a unique page. This is how definite chronological order is achieved. Chapters, scenes, and page numbers may be changed at any time. This doesn't disrupt the ownership because things are linked via GlobalIDs, rather than the numbers of the scenes, etc. It does, however, allow us to rearrange scenes and chapters, pages, etc. Characters and Settings are not part of the chronological system. They can be drawn from and linked to certain other objects (lines and scenes, respectively) but are free of being chained to any particular story, chapter, scene, or page.</p><h5>Permissions System</h5><p>A story has an owner. That owner can add users to a list of those who may edit objects within the story. Also, the owner adds characters and settings to their respective lists: StChar - which characters may appear in the story, and StSett - which settings may be used in the story. So, as we mentioned earlier, Characters and Settings exist outside of a story (though they are sure to be used within stories). They are at the same point in the hierarchy as the story itself. This way, the same people and places are used in different stories very easily and consistently. Characters and Settings also have Editors. If a person has permission to edit a story, their editing rights do not carry over onto the character itself. In order to be able to edit a character or setting, they need to be an editor on that character or setting, NOT just on a story that it exists in.</p><h5>Versioning System</h5><p>When a change is made to an object, rather than literally making those changes to its database entry, what actually happens is that it is cloned, then the changes are made to that clone. After this is done, the previous version is assigned a new GlobalID, which is entered into the new version's PrevID field, and its Active field is set to 0. The Author and Created fields remain the same for all generations, but the Editor and Modified fields are reset to the user doing the changes when a new version is made. New versions will be made when changes are made to the Content field.</p><h5>Comments System</h5><p>Comments are attached to objects via GlobalID. If comments are to be displayed for a given object, a time/date-sorted list is displayed of comments that are tied to that object. Remember, the -current- version of an object has the all-time GlobalID, so old comments still appear.</p><h5>Tags System</h5><p>Tags are allowed on any of the objects except for comments (and users). This allows flexibility in the system for groups collaborating on a project to be able to organize the content and workflow in a more customized way. For instance, an editor could skim through a story and tag various objects as \"Good\", \"Terrible\", and \"Awful\". Then they could prioritize going through to fix all the \"Awful\" bits, then the \"Terrible\", and so on, in order. A search can be done under any of the normal criteria (i.e. story, text, etc) but adding a search for the tags field allows a nicer way to enable specific searching if desired. Story owners have an option to hide tags from all but editors.</p>",

            "description": "<p>This project is a digital musical instrument I created from scratch using Native Instruments Reaktor 5 software. The basic idea behind it is to allow a unique, flexible, and very musical way to manipulate various melodic and rhythmic samples or loops in a real-time performance. Essentially, users of this instrument can load in some samples or loops, either those of a related set (i.e. the various beats and samples of an existing song) or a hodge podge of unrelated materials, and easily combine them in any number of ways to create a remix on the fly.</p><p>The instrument features eight sampler modules, four different sequencers, several unique effects, two inline delay modules, three separate stereo audio busses, and a handful of other goodies.</p><p>Users can \"chop\" and rearrange samples via any of the four sequencers using two distinct types of interface via the sequencing page. These templates are then applied to any or all of the samples/loops that have been loaded into the instrument at the user's will, and can be changed on the fly. </p><p>Each of the samples can be assigned to either the A, B, or C audio busses, allowing quick and easy \"mute group\"-like functionality. Each bus routes through its own independent repeater module (though they can be chained together), which is constantly recording and playing back a user-set amount of musical time and can be triggered to replace the audio stream at any moment, truncated, repeated itself, and even played back in reverse. Any of the included effects modules have switches for engaging bus A and/or B, while bus C is the \"isolation\" bus that does not go to any of the effects modules or repeaters.</p><p>The effects included in the instrument provide unique twists on classic effects. The dynamic distortion is set by the user to adjust its frequency range and level of distortion based on the amplitude of the incoming signal, producing interesting results particularly on percussive elements. The cutter provides a horizontal grid where the user can toggle a series of time segments on or off, then apply these to the amplitude envelope of a given bus in various ways. The CutnPaste effect is another type of inline delay that is able to repeatedly replace a portion of a bus' audio signal with another portion of it, similar to the inline delay on some high end DJ mixers, or the \"Beat Repeat\" effect in Ableton Live. </p><p>Finally, the Table Filter effect shows a grid which the user can either draw in with the mouse, or manually set via a knob on the screen or MIDI controller. The curve drawn in this grid is then repeated over a user-chosen interval and then applied to the filter envelope of an audio bus, resulting in a looped filter effect. Of course, the most fun is had when combining all these different effects together, and in conjunction with the various sequencer functions.</p><p>Of course, it's always much better to try things first hand than to simply hear about it, so if you'd like to try it out for yourself (you'll need a copy of NI Reaktor 5), you can download the ensemble & some sample loops here:<blockquote><a href=\"http://www.osmihi.com/projects/reaktorHouse/reaktorHouse.zip\">reaktorHouse.zip</a></blockquote></p>",

The problem I was having was that, between the different college job boards, craigslist, various employment websites, individual companies, and traditional print ads, it was becoming impossible to keep track of what listings I'd liked and to stay focused.</p><p>So I created a database that would house the various relevant information for a given job listing, i.e. job title, company, URL, contact info, and any notes I had. I also made sure I could categorize the jobs and assign a priority, or level of interest to each. As soon as some or all of this information is entered, it is viewable in a chart alongside any other listings I've entered into the system.</p><p>From this chart, I can update the information, sort by category or by priority, and with one click mark which ones I've applied to and/or heard back from. This allows me to glance at one screen and get an idea of what progress I've made, and also helps me make sure I'm not letting an opportunity I might be interested in slip by.</p><p>This has proven a more reliable strategy than the handwritten notes and e-mails to myself that I had been using before.</p><p>Another issue I came across was that, since I wasn't always doing my searching from the same computer, I didn't consistently have access to my set of job-search bookmarks/favorites. This problem inspired me to add another section to the application where I could simply store and organize my various weblinks, enabling me to have convenient access from anywhere. Also, rather than simply creating a list of links like most browsers do, I thought it might be more useful in this specific situation to have a hierarchy of links. This way I could add a link for a general site like craigslist, for instance, and then place links to its specific sections as children beneath it. I've found this works well for saving specific search terms on sites, so I can just check back at the various URLs I've saved without having to reconstruct each search every time I'm poking around for new listings.</p><p>I later incorporated another feature to help make things more efficient. Despite the generally clean workflow of the site, it was starting to feel a little cumbersome to enter information for each listing when adding more than a couple listings at a time. The solution that I found was to find a way to simply drag and drop the URL of the listing into a field, and then as soon as I click \"Submit\" to let the app take care of the rest. Given a url, the app will retrieve the information contained in the title tag of the page and save that into the record. A subtle improvement, yes, but cutting out some of that extra hassle enables one to focus more on the actual task at hand.</p><p>This web application provides a simple drag-and-drop interface to centralize all job search prospects, progress, and resources in one place with minimal effort. Most importantly, however, I was able to learn some new tricks and techniques while making my job hunt a little less routine.</p>",

Also, I can add any number of different pictures to a project entry and its page will be formatted accordingly. And just for fun, I've made it so each time you visit the project page a new random photo will be chosen from the set of associated pictures for each project and displayed beside it.

Not that I expect anyone to be impressed by that, just thought it was worth mentioning :)</p><p><strong>You can play the game through your web browser via the applet on <a href=\"http://www.osmihi.com/battle\" target=\"_blank\">this page:</a></strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.osmihi.com/battle\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.osmihi.com/battle</a></p><p>(Just a heads up, it can take about 5 seconds to load the battle screen, so please be patient.)</p><div style=\"border-bottom: 1pt solid black; width: 100%;\"></div><p><em>note: the Java applet will require Java 6 or newer to be installed.
